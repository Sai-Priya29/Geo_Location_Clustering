# Geo_Location_Clustering
This project applies the k-Means clustering algorithm to geo-location data to identify meaningful location-based clusters. By grouping geographic coordinates, it helps uncover patterns such as customer distribution, hotspot areas, or regional behaviors for better spatial analysis and decision-making.
